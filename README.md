# Diabetes-Patients-Prediction-Using-Python
**Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques in Python. It utilizes a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., to train a predictive model.<br>

**Features**
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features.<br>
Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model.<br>
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.<br>
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new data samples.<br>
**Requirements**<br>
Python (>=3.6)<br>
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)<br>
Pandas<br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Seaborn<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
