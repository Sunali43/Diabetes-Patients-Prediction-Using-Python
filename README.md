# Diabetes-Patients-Prediction-Using-Python
**Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques in Python. It utilizes a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., to train a predictive model.

**Features**
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features.
Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model.
Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new data samples.
**Requirements**
Python (>=3.6)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
